This is the react app of a blog application from section 5 of the fullstackopen, section 5.

Here are some notes:

Create-react-app has installed ESlint to the project by default, so all that's left for you to do is to define your desired configuration in the .eslintrc.js file.

NB: do not run the eslint --init command. It will install the latest version of ESlint that is not compatible with the configuration file created by create-react-app!
